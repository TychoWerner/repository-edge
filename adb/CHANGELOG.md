## What’s changed

⚠️  **This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

This add-on was created at the time, that the best solution for communicating
with an Android device from Home Assistant, was using an Android Debug Bridge.

However, times have changed. Right now, the Home Assistant project recommends
using built-in Python implementation, which renders this add-on obsolete.

Additionally, this add-on will become problematic to maintain in the future,
as the packages used are stalled.

Therefore, this add-on is now deprecated.
