## What’s changed

### ⚠️  This add-on is now deprecated

This add-on used to be helpful when in need of getting the signed certificates
of your Lutron Caseta smart bridge in order to use it with Home Assistant.

Nowadays, Home Assistant does support/help with this itself and this add-on
is therefore no longer needed.

If you want to integrate Lutron Caseta with Home Assistant, then follow
the instructions on the Home Assistant Lutron Caseta integration documentation
page:

home-assistant.io/integrations/lutron_caseta/#configuration
